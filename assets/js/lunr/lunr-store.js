MGIF   Must Get In Front   A driver who overtakes at speed, only to soon get stuck in slow moving traffic or at a red light.   Right Hook   A driver failing to give way when turning right across your lane or path.   SMIDSY   Sorry Mate!

        "excerpt":"Welcome to the London Bikecam Guide 👋   This site is intended to serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to use a video camera while cycling in Greater London.   If you are considering using a camera while cycling, start by thinking about why you might want to run a camera, or perhaps jump straight to choosing a camera if you’re sure you want to use one.   On the other hand, if you already have a camera you may want to learn how to use it, how to mount it, and what to do after an incident.   Once you have some footage from your camera, you’ll want to review your footage, make video clips, and maybe submit reports to the Met. If you make reports, you’re also likely to get responses from the Met and if you’re (un)lucky you may even be asked to attend court.   🚧 Under Construction 🚧   This site is very new and a work-in-progress. Any contributions and suggestions are welcome.   For now, please look at the headings on the left and suggest some content 😊.   Contributing   If you would like to suggest new content, please open an issue on the GitHub repo. Alternatively, if you’d like to contribute some content directly, you can fork the repo and open a pull request.   If you don’t know what any of that means, that’s okay too. get in contact with me on twitter if you’d like to contribute 😄.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Report a Driving Offence",
        "excerpt":"If you’ve witnessed a driving offence or have been in involved in an traffic incident where no people or vehicles collided, you can submit a report online.   You have a maximum of 10 days to report a driving offence. The Metropolitan Police have 14 days from the time of the offence to notify the registered keeper. They give us – the general public – 10 days so they have time to process submissions and send out letters.   You should absolutely not wait this long. You should submit a report as soon as is practical to ease pressure on the police staff reviewing submissions.   The form allows you to upload your evidence (i.e. video footage) directly on the Met’s website. There’s no need to upload the footage anywhere else unless the offence occurred in the City of London.   Steps in the form   There are lots of steps in this form which can seem daunting at first. After you’ve gone through it a few times you’ll be able to fill it in much faster than you did the first time.   Pick the location on a map   If you’re saving Open Location Codes or GPS coordinates with your footage (you’ll know if you are), you can just paste them straight into the search box and hit enter/return.   Otherwise, you’re going to have to click about on a very small map to specify where the incident took place. Try to be as precise as possible.   Your statement   You’ll need to make a declaration about the truthfulness of your statement. You’re being asked to declare that you’re making a statement which you believe to be true. Read carefully.   Your details   You can use your web browser’s autofill features to fill in some these fields for you. Search the web for the name of your web browser and “autofill” if you don’t know how to use it.   Your role in the incident   You’ll probably want to pick “cyclist” here.   Other people involved   You can mention several people in a single incident. It’s probably best to group several reports together if they happen at the same time, for example if two vehicles close pass you in just a few seconds.   Do not mention witnesses who were not involved in the incident. That comes later.   Pick the type of vehicle involved in the incident. When choosing the type of vehicle don’t worry if you don’t know the engine capacity of a moped/motorbike or the maximum gross weight of a goods vehicle. There are options for “don’t know”.   Checking Vehicle Details   You can check the make, colour, and type of vehicle on the DVLA website by entering the vehicle’s registration. This is a useful way of double-checking that you are reporting the right vehicle because you can verify the make and colour of the vehicle.   Checking PHVs   You can check whether a vehicle is a registered private hire vehicle (PHV) via TfL’s private hire website. You’ll probably want to enter the registration (VRM) without spaces.   Incident details   Specify the date and time of the incident. If you have GPS timestamps, use those. Remember that if the offence occurred when the UK was in summer time (BST) you will need to add 1 hour to any time from your camera that is marked as UTC. If you’re using your camera’s own timestamps (e.g. from the video file’s metadata or an on-screen timestamp) make sure these are correct.   Tick all the offences that you believe your report relates to. For example, if you were close passed by a driver who ran a red light then you might pick both “driving through a red light” and “cycling close pass”.   The other fields on this page are mostly self explanatory. Make sure you explain the actions you took in the inident, too. For example, if you were forced to brake hard to avoid a collision, mention that you were forced to brake hard to avoid a collision.   Upload your evidence   You don’t have to upload 4 minutes of footage (2 minutes before and 2 minutes after). You only have to upload enough footage for the offence/incident to be clear. However, make sure that you keep the original copy of the footage in case it is requested by the police as evidence.   If you are reporting an offence within the jurisdiction of the Metrpolitan Police, you will be given the opportunity to upload video files, up to 1000MB each. Remember to click the green “Upload” button so your file(s) upload in the background while you complete the rest of the form.   If you are reporting an offence which occurred in the City of London, however, you will not be given the option to upload the footage. Instead, you will need to upload the footage to a video sharing or file sharing website and then use a sharing link in the form. You can use Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Apple iCloud, or YouTube to do this, to name a few options. If you upload your video to a video sharing website such as YouTube, make sure that the video is “unlisted”.   When describing your footage, make sure to mention the make and model of your camera so that the police are aware that your camera might have a very wide field-of-view which makes objects appear smaller and further away than they really are. You may also wish to mention whether you were using video stabilisation on your camera, if it has that feature.   If there’s an incorrect date and time visible on your video, mention how and why it’s wrong.   If all you’ve done is create a video clip or rotated a video because it was upside down, you probably haven’t met the criteria for “digitally altering or enhancing” your footage. Make sure to mention if you’ve cut bits out of the video, or if you’ve changed its speed, or edited the audio. Basically, mention anything you’ve done to the video except making a single clip from a longer video, or flipping the video the right way up.   Witnesses   Use your own discretion here. If you’re out cycling with 10 friends, it’s probably not necessary to enter everyone’s details for a “minor” incident. On the other hand, it may be useful to mention a witness if the incident was very serious or if everything isn’t obvious from the video footage you uploaded.   Review   After the footage has finished uploading you’ll be able to review your answers. If you save the dates, times, or registration plates in the filenames of your video clips then now is a good time to cross-check the various form fields to make sure you’ve chosen the right clips.   Sign   You will be asked if you’re willing to attend court. If you pick “yes”, you’re stating that you’re willing to appear at court as a witness if necessary. If you pick “no” and/or refuse to appear as a witness, the police and CPS might decide not to prosecute in case the driver pleads “not guilty”.   It is extremely unlikely that you will be asked to attend court. You will only be asked to attend when both the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) agree on taking the driver to court and when the driver pleads “not guilty”. I have never been asked to attend court and people who have been making reports for upwards of a decade have only been asked to attend court a handful of times:   The only other thing I would add is the rarity that you need to attend court. You only need to attend if the Met and CPS agree to take them to court and they plead not-guilty initially. This has happened to me 3 times in the past 10 years of reports. &mdash; CycleGaz™ (@cyclegaz) December 1, 2020    Once you submit the form you’ll be given a reference number. Save that number somewhere for your records. You’ll also be given the opportunity to download a copy of your report, which you may want to keep.   After this, you’re all done.   Get back out there and enjoy yourself 🚲  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"If you’re cycling and you have your camera running, there are a few steps you can take to make sure your footage is usable as police evidence and so that it is easy to review.   These steps aren’t strictly necessary, but they’re the ones I follow.   There are additional steps you must take if you’re involved in a road traffic collision   1. Say the vehicle registration aloud   As soon as it is safe to do so, state the registration of the vehicle loudly and clearly so that it can be picked up by your camera’s microphone. Do this even if you’re unsure whether the license plate will be visible in your video.   Use a phonetic alphabet if you know one (e.g. say “Mike” instead of “M”, and “November” instead of “N”). If you don’t know one, try learning the NATO phonetic alphabet. Using a phonetic alphabet, you might say the registration “AA12 XYZ” as “Alpha Alpha One Two, X-ray Yankee Zulu”.   Why?   Your camera might not capture the vehicle registration plate perfectly, e.g. if the vehicle is moving at speed, or if it’s raining or dark outside.   In many situations you might find yourself with only a partial plate or an ambiguous letter in the registration. For example, you might mis-read “AA12 XYZ” as “AA12 XVZ”. By saying the registration aloud you remove this ambiguity and you make it easier for you and the police to identify the vehicle.   2. Say what happened   State what happened in the incident, even if it’s brief. Say what you’d say if you were telling someone what just happened.   Why?   Saying what happened will make it easier when you come to write the report. You might forget exactly how you felt or other things about the incident that aren’t obvious in the video. By saying it as it happens, you’re essentially giving yourself a spoken record of what happened without all the problems of trying to remember it all later on.   3. Click the bookmark button on your camera   When it’s safe to do so, click the button on your camera which creates a bookmark, if it has one. If you can’t – or don’t feel safe trying to – reach the button while you’re cycling, click it later on and say why you clicked it, e.g. “I got close passed a few minutes ago”.   Why?   You might have several hours of video footage and you probably don’t want to watch all of it in fast-forward. By clicking the bookmark button you can skip through all of your footage to exactly where the incidents occurred, saving you a huge amount of time when reviewing footage.   4. Enjoy the rest of your ride 😄   Let the anger, fear, and adrenaline wear off. There’s nothing else you can do right now which will make a difference.   Go back to enjoying the ride 😄  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Your Rights on the Road",
        "excerpt":"Lots of people will tell you lots of little lies about how cyclists should and should not behave on the roads on the UK. Many of these people may not have ever read the highway code. Some of them may be angry drivers shouting at you for exercising your legal rights on the road.   The gist of it is that cyclists have the same priority and rights as motor vehicles. This means other road users must give way to you at T-junctions, roundabouts, and in multi-lane traffic just as if you were driving a car.   There are two things you should do:     Read the Highway Code   Know your Rights   Don’t fall victim to common misconceptions   Note: This was correct at the time of writing. Check the bottom of the page for the date of last edit.   Read The Highway Code   The Highway Code should be considered your source of truth for how to ride a bicycle on the roads in the UK. There are rules for cyclists which mostly relate to safety, but there are also important rules about bicycle aspects at traffic lights and on road crossings which you should know about.   Try reading it from beginning to end on a wet afternoon. It’s not that long and it will help clear up a lot of misconceptions.   Know Your Rights   The law offers you some protection when you’re on a bicycle. In addition to having the same priorities at junctions as motor vehicles, you are also entitled to be overtaken safely.   Basically, you should be respected by other road users. That’s what the highway code is meant to be about: road users should respect each other, with everyone using the Highway Code to guide their behaviour.   Safe Overtakes   Anyone driving a motor vehicle must overtake you safely. They must give you enough space, for some definition of “enough”. In practice this means that a driver must leave enough space for you not to be put in danger. Think to yourself: if you fell off your bicycle right there and then, would the driver have enough time to react and either avoid you or stop before they hit you? If the answer is no, then the other vehicle is too close.   This means that what the police or a magistrate would consider to be a safe overtake usually scales with the speed of the vehicles involved. For example, if the traffic is stopped or bumper-to-bumper, it might be safe for you to filter amongst the vehicles without it being considered dangerous. On the other hand, it is not safe if a driver passes you with less than 1.5m to spare on a road with a 20mph or 30mph speed limit. At higher speeds, drivers should give you even more space: a driver has no business putting their vehicle in the same lane as you on a 40mph, 50mph, or even 60mph road.   There is one rule of thumb, though: if you can touch the motor vehicle, it’s too close.   Priority over other vehicles   Other vehicles must give way to you just as if you were a car. This means that you have priority over traffic entering from side roads at a T-junction, and over other traffic entering a roundabout that you’re already on.   More importantly, this also means that other vehicles must give way to you if they want to cross your lane unless signs and road markings indicate otherwise. This includes cycle lanes and bus lanes, too.   Remember: an indicator doesn’t magically give priority.   The lane is yours   You are entitled to use the full lane, as if you were a car.   No ifs, no buts, no asterisks.   It’s that simple.   Clearing Up Common Misconceptions   There are some common misconceptions about modern-day cycling in the UK. Some of these may be the result of the old “Cycling Proficiency” you may have taken at school, which since been abandoned by the govenment and cycling advocacy groups.   A lot of these misconceptions might be the result of being told things by an adult when you were young, or perhaps by an angry driver who’s proved to you the existence of their middle finger.   In no particular order, let’s clear some up.   You don’t have to use cycle lanes      “Get in the cycle lane”!     An angry driver    Use of dedicated cycle lanes is not compulsory. They can make your journey safer, but some of them make your journey more dangerous. Use your own jugement and discretion 😄   You can ride on the carriageway of nearly any road, except on motorways, or where cycling is explicitly prohibited. You will know if you’re not allowed to cycle on a road because it will have one of the two following signs:                You are allowed to cycle past “no motor vehicle” signs like this:           You don’t have to ride at the edge of the road   No part of the highway code requires you to cycle in the gutter. Cycle wherever you feel safe and comfortable.   You don’t have to dismount   At the time of writing, blue rectangular “cyclists dismount” signs have no legal standing. They are merely advisory. You do not have to dismount just because you see this sign:           You are allowed to filter through traffic   You are allowed to ride your bicycle amongst slow or stationary traffic and overtake it. You must obey all other road laws whilst doing so: you mustn’t mount the pavement or cycle on the wrong side of traffic islands which have blue arrow signs, for example.   You don’t have to wear a helmet   Bicycle helmets are not a legal requirement. It’s up to you if you wear one.   You can wear what you want   You don’t have to wear high-visibility or reflective clothing. You can wear a disonaur onesie, a lovely summer dress, or anything, really. Some people even cycle naked.   You don’t need lights during the day   You are legally required to use a front white light and a rear red light at night, i.e. between sunset and sunrise. It’s up to you when to use lights at all other times.  ","categories": [],
