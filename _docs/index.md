Welcome to the London Bikecam Guide :wave:

This site is intended to serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to use a video camera while cycling in Greater London.

If you are considering using a camera while cycling, start by thinking about [why you might want to run a camera]({% link _docs/why-run-a-camera.md %}), or perhaps jump straight to [choosing a camera]({% link _docs/choosing-a-camera.md %}) if you're sure you want to use one.

On the other hand, if you already have a camera you may want to learn [how to use it]({% link _docs/camera-quick-start.md %}), [how to mount it]({% link _docs/mounting.md %}), and [what to do after an incident]({% link _docs/what-to-do-after-an-incident.md %}).

Once you have some footage from your camera, you'll want to [review your footage]({% link _docs/reviewing-your-footage.md %}), [make video clips]({% link _docs/making-video-clips.md %}), and maybe [submit reports to the Met]({% link _docs/report-a-driving-offence.md %}).
If you make reports, you're also likely to get [responses from the Met]({% link _docs/email-responses.md %}) and if you're (un)lucky you may even be [asked to attend court]({% link _docs/attending-court.md %}).
