## Glossary

There's a kind of shorthand amongst cyclists in London (and elsewhere!) to describe some of the incidents they're involved in.

Here are some of the terms you may see on social media.

### Left Hook

A driver failing to give way when turning left across your lane or path.

### MGIF

_Must Get In Front_

A driver who overtakes at speed, only to soon get stuck in slow moving traffic or at a red light.

### Right Hook

A driver failing to give way when turning right across your lane or path.

### SMIDSY

_Sorry Mate! I Didn't See You_

When a driver fails to give way to you but then notices you and responds "sorry mate! I didn't see you" despite the fact that you were clearly visible.
